# Meowtillary
Meowtillary is a light-loaded RPG that works as a contant-environment game with no use of leveling up. 
Character starts as a default (one character) and is monologued to take care of Cat's Cat Cafe. 
MC starts creating biomedically engineered cat weapons: Cattana, Catlass, etc.
Along with this, non-hostile features of the game include feeding the cats, giving water as needed, and maintaining the cat cafe.
This maintenance system is implemented with a timer above each individual cat.
Slowly, enemies for MC to encounter and fight "PYTA" spawn in waves to shut down the use of cats as artillary.
These enemy encounters start as waves and spread from easy to intermediate level. As to not disturb the inherent
tone of the game, enemy encounters will never be too intense.
